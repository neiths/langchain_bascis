This can help reduce the pain.\n* **Hydrate:** Drink some water. Dehydration can sometimes trigger headaches. \n* **Cold compress:** Apply a cold compress or ice pack wrapped in a towel to your forehead or the back of your neck.\n* **Over-the-counter pain relievers:** If the headache is bothering you, you can try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n\nIf the headache gets worse or doesn't go away after an hour or two, or if you have any other symptoms like dizziness, nausea, or trouble seeing, it's best to see a doctor just to be safe. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! \n",
